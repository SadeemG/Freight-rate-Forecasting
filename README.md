"# Freight-rate-Forecasting" 
This Project aim was to find whether Forward Frate rate agreements carry market information that can be useful in predicting freight rates.

The project focuses on the Baltic Panamax Dry Bulk containers and attempts to forecast for the years 2022, 2023. 
The conclusion is that short term maturity contracts hold the most useful information since they are liquid and are most reactive to market news, this meant that as an exogenous variable it led to better performance as compared to an ARIMA (1,0,1).
